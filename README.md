Gotta drink 'em all


Development
===========

1. Run `bundle install` at the root to install gem dependencies.
2. Run `rackup` or use [Pow](http://pow.cx/) if you prefer going to `http://pokebooze.dev/`

Any asset changes will happen on page refresh. Changes to routes will require a server restart.


To Do
=====

- Indicate current player in UI
- Pretty dice
- LocalStorage of game state
- ChromeCast compatibility
- S.S. Anne Logic and UI
- Decide whether Fearow should mean dice rolls aswell
